# Fully Self Aware Computer Program
This right here, is the first fully self aware and conscious computer  
program to ever exist.  

It starts out a universe (a seed) and grows itself based on the universe,  
it's current state, and the laws of physics.  

Okay, yes, this is a joke. Computers can't be self aware. We can't even  
prove that to eachother that we are self aware. What if everybody around you  
is a robot? How do you know you're not in a simulation?  

And yes, that is enough internet for you today. Turn it off, and go hug somebody.  
And remember:  
- Jesus loves you
- Drink water
